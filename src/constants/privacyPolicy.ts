4. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We share it only:
- Service Providers: We use trusted third-party vendors to host and process data on our behalf—currently Supabase (cloud database and authentication). Providers may access personal data only to perform services for us and must protect it to standards equal to this Policy.
- Analytics & Advertising Partners (future): If we integrate third-party analytics or advertising networks, we will update this Policy and request any required App Tracking Transparency (ATT) consent.
- Legal & Safety: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property of users or LAB307.
- Business Transfers: In a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, user information may transfer as permitted by law.

5. Data Retention

We store your data only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes outlined above, unless a longer period is required by law. If you delete your account, we erase your personal data within 30 days, except for minimal records we must keep for legal or security reasons.

6. Your Rights & Choices

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data;
- Object to or restrict processing;
- Withdraw consent at any time (e.g., disable analytics, delete account);
- Port your data to another service.

You can exercise many of these rights directly in the App under Settings → Privacy. For additional requests, email us at support@lab307.studio.

7. Security

We implement technical and organisational measures—encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, regular audits—to protect your data. No system is 100% secure; you share information at your own risk.

The App is not intended for anyone under 16. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16. If we learn we have, we will delete it promptly.

10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via in-app notice or email. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the revised Policy.
